# SI 699 - DTE Aerial Photo Collection Digital Curation project
# Batch Processing Workflow Proof of Concept

## Purpose of Scripts

These scripts were written as part of a digital curation project for a mastery course at the University of Michigan School of Information. Our client, Wayne State University Libraries Digital Collections unit, had asked us to investigate the PDF files that comprise the [DTE Aerial Photo Collection] (https://digital.library.wayne.edu/dte_aerial/). To assist with migrating the collection into the library's collection platform, we were asked to investigate whether the aerial photograph PDFs had embedded image files that could be extracted and how we might recreate the information contained with the index map PDFs in records for each individual image.

The scripts contained with this repository are designed to solve both of these tasks. **extract_using_pypdf.py** and **extract_using_poppler.py** represent two scripts capable of programmatically extracting JPEG bytestreams and image metadata from the photo PDFs and document and link metadata from the index PDFs in a target directory. **georeference_links.py** uses the link metadata generated by the extraction scripts to convert internal PDF coordinates into geocoordinates (latitude-longitude pairs). **process_batch.py** integrates the workflows laid out in the extract_using_pypdf.py and georeference_links.py scripts and combines the results of both into comprehensive image-level records for each new JPEG file created. Each script -- its dependencies, its inputs and outputs, and how to run it -- is described in detail below.
